        Lions have famously acquired the title of ‘King of the Jungle’. However, the title is a little misleading as lions don’t actually live in jungles
         (and as we found out earlier, they don't have kings!). Their habits include scrubland, grasslands, savannahs and rocky hills, but not jungles. 
         This is a simple case of lost in translation.
      </br>
        The word jungle has its roots is the Hindi word ‘jangle’ which means forest or wasteland - the latter could easily be applied to a savannah. 
        The lion’s other title of ‘King of beasts’ won’t be disputed here. If you’d like to challenge it, please take the matter up with your nearest lion.</p>
      <h2>Why I like this animal</h2>
        <p id="funText">ONE REASON for the confusion is that 'jungle' is derived from the Hindi 
          (and thus also from Sanskrit) words. There are no tropical forests in India, and the definitive
          text on the derivation of the word (Frances Zimmermann's 'Jungle and the Aroma of Meats')
          makes a good case for saying that 'jangala' really meant an open savannah-like terrain, 
          very suitable for the Indian lion. How 'jungle' came to be understood in British English
          as a thick tropical forest with creepers etc. is still somewhat unclear; the Hindi word
          'jungle' in rural north India is a term still
          very much in use to describe the fields and the margins of cultivated lands such as common grazing lands.</p>
